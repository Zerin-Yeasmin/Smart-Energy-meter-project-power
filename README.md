# Smart-Energy-meter-project-power
Implementing a smart energy meter that includes cost calculation, and over-consumption protection
This project aimed to receive input current from any electrical 
equipment and then feed it through the smart energy meter, which would calculate 
current and voltage to determine power use and anticipated electricity cost.
This meter is compatible with the electrical appliances we use daily, such as the
oven, refrigerator, TV, etc. The power measurement and how much 
electricity that specific gadget is using will be provided after that. Additionally, it 
will show us the per-unit cost estimate and the overall cost of that specific gadget 
during the time in question. With such information, we can estimate how long the 
device is going to operate, how much it will cost, and whether we should turn it off 
if it is using too much power.
Overall, this energy meter will serve as a unit of measurement for the majority of 
individuals who are not electrically literate but who can nevertheless compute the 
paid price and the time frame according to their understanding.
